# TECtools - TECdisplay tools

This sub-directories within this directory contain README files for the following programs:

`variant_maker` - Generates a targets file for user-specified sequence variants.

`TECdisplay_mapper` - Processes and maps sequencing reads to targets.

`merge_TECdisplay_replicates` - Merges data from replicate TECdisplay experiments.

`calc_FracBound_difference` - Calculates the difference in fraction bound for all variants in two TECdisplay datasets.

`TECdisplay_navigator` - Filters data for variants that match user-specified constraints.

`TECdisplay_Hnav` - Hierarchically filters data for variants that match a series of user-specified constraints.

`id2variant` - Reconstructs complete variant sequences from variant ids.
